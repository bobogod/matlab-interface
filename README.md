# Matlab Interface

The Matlab plugin for the Open Ephys GUI allows users to stream live data from the Open Ephys GUI to a live Matlab session. A Matlab API is included which allows seamless processing of the incoming data in real-time. This is an early release of the plugin that currently supports streaming a single channel to Matlab in real time. If you are interested in additional functionality, please open an issue describing your intended use case and we can prioritize development based on demand. 

## Installation:

#### *Option 1: Download pre-compiled binaries*

If you are using the pre-compiled version of the Open Ephys GUI, you should download the pre-compiled Matlab plugin for your particular platform in the table below. Once downloaded, extract the .zip file contents into the plugins directory of your Open Ephys folder.  

| Platform | Link |
|----------|------|
|Windows   |[matlab-plugin-for-windows](https://dl.bintray.com/open-ephys-gui-plugins/MatlabInterface/MatlabInterface-windows_0.1.0-API7.zip)|
|Linux     |[matlab-plugin-for-linux](https://dl.bintray.com/open-ephys-gui-plugins/MatlabInterface/MatlabInterface-linux_0.1.0-API7.zip)|
|Mac       |[matlab-plugin-for-mac](https://dl.bintray.com/open-ephys-gui-plugins/MatlabInterface/MatlabInterface-mac_0.1.0-API7.zip)|

#### *Option 2: Build from source*

If you have compiled the Open Ephys GUI from source already, you can compile the Matlab plugin from source as well. As with all outside plugins, the root folder should be stored *inside* a directory at the same level as the plugin-GUI. For example: 

```
plugin-GUI
└───Source
└───Build

OEPlugins
└───MatlabEngine
    └───Source
    └───Build
    └───MatlabAPI
```
Using the above directory format, installing from source (on Linux) would look like this:

    cd OEPlugins
    git clone https://github.com/open-ephys-plugins/matlab-plugin.git
    cd Build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
    make install


## Usage:

Once installed, the plugin will appear as 'MatlabEngine' in the 'Filters' section of the 'Processor List' of the Open Ephys GUI. The Matlab plugin can be placed after any source or filter in the signal chain and will stream the data generated by the preceding processor into your Matlab session. 

When you are ready to acquire data, you will need to press the 'Connect' button in the 'MatlabEngine' editor to initiate a connection between Open Ephys and your Matlab session. The plugin will open a socket using the IP and Port address listed in the MatlabEngine editor.

To initialize the connection on the Matlab side, you will need to call your generated script from Matlab following the instructions below. Once the connection has been initiated on both sides, pressing the Play button in the Open Ephys GUI will automatically stream the incoming data to Matlab. 

### *Matlab API*

In order to process the incoming data in Matlab, you will need to leverage the included Matlab API. The API was designed specifically to introduce/reinforce object oriented programming and to encourage Matlab evangelists to consider developing plugins in C++. 

The Matlab API is centered around a GenericProcessor class that encapsulates an Open Ephys data processor. The idea is to write your own class that inherits and extends a Generic Processor. A starting template is included below: 

    classdef MyClass < GenericProcessor
	
        properties
            %define any variables you want to keep track of here (see examples)
        end

        methods 

            function self = Plotter(host, port)
                
                self = self@GenericProcessor(host, port);

                %Initialize any variables here (see examples)

                self.process();

            end

        end

        methods (Access = protected)

            function process(self)
                
                while (true) 

                    process@GenericProcessor(self); 

                    numSamples = self.dataIn.numSamplesFetched;
                    
                    data = self.dataIn.continuous(1:end);

                    %Do whatever you want with the data here (see examples)

                end

            end

        end

    end

Here's an example of a simple peak detection algorithm:

    classdef PeakDetector < GenericProcessor

        properties
            peaks;
        end
        
        methods 

            function self = PeakDetector(host, port)
                
                self = self@GenericProcessor(host, port);
                self.process();

            end

        end

        methods (Access = protected)

            function process(self)
                
                while (true)
                    process@GenericProcessor(self); 
                    
                    yd = diff(self.dataIn.continuous)./diff(1:self.dataIn.numSamplesFetched);
                    self.peaks = find(~yd);
                    
                end

            end

        end

    end

And a simple threshold detector... 

    classdef ThresholdDetector < GenericProcessor

        properties
            thresholdValue;
        end
    
        methods 

            function self = ThresholdDetector(host, port)
                
                self = self@GenericProcessor(host, port);
                
                self.thresholdValue = 3.2; %V
                
                self.process();

            end

        end

        methods (Access = protected)

            function process(self)
                
                while (true)
                    
                    process@GenericProcessor(self); 
                    k = find(self.dataIn.continuous > self.thresholdValue);

                end

            end

        end

    end


And here's an example of a Plotter that plots the incoming data to a figure in real-time. 

    classdef Plotter < GenericProcessor

        properties
            hPlot;
        end
        
        properties
            xAxisRange;
            yAxisRange;
        end

        methods 

            function self = Plotter(host, port)
                
                self = self@GenericProcessor(host, port);
                
                self.xAxisRange = [0,80000];
                self.yAxisRange = [-1000 1000];
                
                plotTitle = 'Open Ephys Data Stream';
                xLabel = 'Sample Count';
                yLabel = 'Voltage [uV]';

                clf; cla; 
                self.hPlot = plot(0,0); drawnow; hold on;
                title(plotTitle);
                xlabel(xLabel); ylabel(yLabel);
                xlim(self.xAxisRange); ylim(self.yAxisRange);
                
                self.process();

            end

        end

        methods (Access = protected)

            function process(self)
                
                lastSample = 0;
                xAxisSize = self.xAxisRange(2);
                
                while ishandle(self.hPlot) 

                    process@GenericProcessor(self); 

                    numSamples = self.dataIn.numSamplesFetched;

                    if lastSample + numSamples > xAxisSize
                        xData = (lastSample+1):xAxisSize;
                        yData = self.dataIn.continuous(1:(xAxisSize-lastSample));
                    else
                        xData = (lastSample+1):(lastSample+numSamples);
                        yData = self.dataIn.continuous;
                    end

                    self.hPlot = plot(xData,yData); drawnow;
                    set(self.hPlot, 'XData', xData, 'YData', yData); 

                    %TODO: Currently ignores (doesn't plot) samples that overshoot x-axis range
                    lastSample = lastSample + numSamples;
                    if lastSample > xAxisSize
                        lastSample = 0;
                        cla; self.hPlot = plot(0,0); drawnow; 
                    end

                end

            end

        end

    end


Once you have designed your class, you can call it from the Matlab command window using MyClass(host,port), where host and port need to match the entries specified in the MatlabEngine editor in the OpenEphys GUI.
